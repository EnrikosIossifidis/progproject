The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb.

Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills.

The blend\u2014two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah\u2014is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums.

It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone.

Best after 2015."}, {"Title": "Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley)", "Points": 94, "Price": 45.0, "Variety": "Syrah", "Description": "Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage.

It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard."}, {"Title": "Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley)", "Points": 94, "Price": 125.0, "Variety": "Bordeaux-style Red Blend", "Description": "Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward."}, {"Title": "Bell 2007 Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)", "Points": 88, "Price": 35.0, "Variety": "Cabernet Sauvignon", "Description": "A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating.

There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar."}, {"Title": "Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Ros\u00e9 (Edna Valley)", "Points": 87, "Price": 18.0, "Variety": "Ros\u00e9", "Description": "With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors.

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak."}, {"Title": "Hahn Estates 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)", "Points": 88, "Price": 14.0, "Variety": "Cabernet Sauvignon", "Description": "Here's a really good value in a dry, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon.

Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice.

Drink now."}, {"Title": "Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curic\u00f3 Valley)", "Points": 86, "Price": 18.0, "Variety": "Merlot", "Description": "Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely."}, {"Title": "De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limar\u00ed Valley)", "Points": 86, "Price": 18.0, "Variety": "Chardonnay", "Description": "Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood."}, {"Title": "Vi\u00f1a Bisquertt 2007 Casa la Joya Reserve Syrah (Colchagua Valley)", "Points": 85, "Price": 11.0, "Variety": "Syrah", "Description": "Formerly doing business as \u201cShiraz,\u201d this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors.

This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc."}, {"Title": "Morand\u00e9 2007 Edici\u00f3n Limitada Carmen\u00e8re (Maipo Valley)", "Points": 90, "Price": 22.0, "Variety": "Carmen\u00e8re", "Description": "It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback.

The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry.

The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste.

The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine.
