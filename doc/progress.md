### Monday Week 1
Made and pushed project proposal (Line graph, heat map and circle graph). It was a solution for policy makers to find the best route for co2 emission reduction regarding coal and gas based power plants.

### Tuesday Week 1
Gathered data and calculated minor parameters for the data vizualisation. But after discussing with Nigel about the project, we decided it did not fit the purpose of the course. 

### Wednesday Week 1
Made plan proposal and design document of new proposal.

New plan: Data vizualisation of wine reviews from all over the world and from all price categories. New proposal: User's choices: Timeslide, Pick Price Category. Vizualisations:  ##Bubble chart## of countries, where bubble size represents number of wines in chosen dataset from that country. When the user clicks on a bubble, a ##Histogram## appears with x-axis: score category (100-90, 90-80, etc.), y-axis: frequency. Beneath the histogram a  ##Donut Graph## is viewed which shows the distribution of wine sorts wihtin score category (Optional: User can choose score category with dropdown menu, otherwise mean is showed).

### Thursday Week 1
Finished design document and started with preparing data. The data from the source was per row a wine with including review. There was no 'year'-column. It was mentioned in the 'Wine title'-column, so I needed to filter the year out. This happens in csvtojson.py.

### Friday Week 1
Next up was sorting the data by year and organize the wines within each year by country.

### Monday Week 2
Started with making the index.html page and javascript file. Trying to make the bubble chart. (But mostly refreshing HTML, JS, D3 knowledge because it's +1 year ago that I last touched it.)
