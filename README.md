### Road to Reduction

Problem Statement:

The spectrum of how to replace fossil-fuel based energy producers is quite broad. Even 'green activists' disagree about the policy that need to be made, Some say only a dozen of nuclear power plants will have a substantial impact on emission reduction, others swear by giant windmills. It's difficult for policy makers not to drown in the many trade-offs and numbers that appear on our road to reduction.

Solution:

This vizualisation attempts to give a clear view of what the impact of the chosen policy will be on emmission reduction. The user can design it's own 'Road to Reduction' by chosing when and how much you invest in which source of energy (wind-, solar- and nuclear power).
