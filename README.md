# Road to Reduction

Problem Statement:

In order to keep our lifestyle as it is, we need to find new energy sources which are clean and infinite. The spectrum of how to reduce our emissions is quite broad. Even 'green activists' disagree about the policy that needs to be made, so that we reach the goal's from the Paris Agreement. Some say only a dozen of nuclear power plants will have a substantial impact on emission reduction, others swear by giant windmills. It's difficult for policy makers not to drown in the many trade-offs and numbers that appear on our road to reduction.

Solution:

This vizualisation attempts to give a clear view of what the impact of the chosen policy will be on emmission reduction. The user can design it's own 'Road to Reduction' by chosing when and how much you invest in which source of energy (wind-, solar- and nuclear power).
